At Calvary Baptist Phillipsburg, our expressed purpose is to glorify God in all that we do. 

We hold to the absolute authority, infallibility, inspiration, and sufficiency of the Scriptures. We boldly proclaim the centrality of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s sovereign grace in salvation. We seek to worship our God and Savior in spirit and truth through the singing of psalms and hymns and by rightly dividing the Scriptures through verse by verse expository preaching.

We are a doctrinally conservative congregation that holds to a reformed understanding of the Scriptures in a Baptistic tradition. The term "reformed" comes from the period of church history called "The Reformation" (1517-1648), when important Biblical truths were recovered and reemphasized, truths that we embrace to this day. At Calvary Baptist Phillipsburg we have chosen to identify ourselves as Reformed Baptists and adhere to the 1689 Second London Baptist Confession of Faith. 

We are also members of the National Family-Integrated Church Network. At the most basic level, the family-integrated church is one that is intentionally designed to eliminate what we believe to be unnecessary, and often harmful, age-segregated structures from the church’s ministry. Therefore, all children at Calvary Baptist Phillipsburg attend all of the corporate worship gatherings with their parents rather than attending a separate children’s ministry. As a family-integrated local church, it is our goal to equip fathers/husbands to lead their wives and children in the worship of God on a daily basis within the home. We desire to cultivate an intergenerational discipleship model by placing the responsibility for disciple-making within the context of the family primarily upon the parents rather than relying on various church programs. While we do not believe that family-integration is the most important matter in church life, we do believe it is the biblical model and, therefore, a critical matter. Our desire is to see families thrive and grow together in the worship of Christ Jesus.
