          Calvary Baptist Exists To:
          Glorify God in Worship. We gather together to worship God in the ways He has expressly revealed in the Bible. This distinctly Christian worship is not based on the whims of believers or unbelievers, but carefully drawn from and centered upon the Scriptures. Jesus said, “But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24).  Our worship services are a means of grace through which God speaks to us and transforms us by his Word.
         
         Glorify God by Edifying His People. We gather together as a church in pursuit of true Christian Fellowship. This is more than idle chit-chat and shared lunches, but rather crucial one-to-one ministry designed to build one another up and bear one another’s burdens . “Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love” (Ephesians 4:15-16).  We actively encourage, edify, educate, and exhort one another that we all may grow in grace and maturity.
         
         Glorify God by Evangelizing the World. We believe that a healthy church is an evangelizing church. While church is first and foremost a gathering of God’s people, it is also a gathering to which unbelievers are invited so they can hear the Gospel message and see it lived out in the life of the church. Churches that become inward focused rather than evangelistic will ultimately lose their love, their zeal, and their vitality. We are commanded by Christ Jesus to, “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you” (Matthew 28:19-20). A church that does not evangelize is in direct disobedience to the commands of our Lord.
         
         Get in touch
         We know that not everyone is comfortable visiting a new church. Perhaps you would like to meet with the Elders to talk about the church before you visit us. We would be happy to meet you at a local restaurant or café and discuss these things over a cup of coffee.
